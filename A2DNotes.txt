A2D Notes
---------

Marketing fluff
---------------
focus on benefit
genuine, snapshots pictures, urgency, energy verbs(??), simple sentences

purpose of headline, pics: get the first sentence read. Purpose of first sentence, get the 2nd sentence read. Etc.
make promise to fulfill later
back up with proof.

direct - promise/benefit right away (30% off)
indirect - subtle/curiosity
news - introducing...
how to - begin with how to
question - empathize with question/answer
command - put a tiger in your tank, strong first verb
reason why - N ways to ... Y reasons why...
testimony - what someone says

obsess over title, 50/50 rule

useful, urgency, unique, ultra-specific

promise reader a reward/benefit
each part: main idea, main purpose, 
don't digress, don't ramble, laser focus
specific assertions, reasons why, otherwise b.s.
demonstrate massive credibility, stats, expert references, testimonials, expert on topic
restate hook, benefit to reader
make offer
sum, return to original promise and demonstrate how promise fulfilled

*** Do more research on anti-aliasing, filtering, oversampling, DSP, etc.

Unique selling point: any sharp ranger? ??  Better (how) than an ADC.
ADC. Smarter. Better. A2D > ADC.
No mess analog.
No fuss, no mess analog conversion.

1. use You
2. features tell, benefits sell
3. reinforce your unique selling point
4. screw grammar
5. delete "that"
6. tell the reader what to do


Create desire, support with features/facts.

7 Science Facts
1. Make 'em feel something, speak to feeling already there
2. Sell time, not money
3. Sweat the small stuff: measure, track improve phrases, wording
4. Devil's advocate (acknowledge and deal with objections), point out concerns, not infallible
5. Verbs beat adjectives
6. Power words: You (name), Free, Because, Instantly, New (product, not brand)
7. Stories, transport to someplace else. Use detailed imagery, suspense, metaphors, irony, modeling


*** research ADC, Sharp, sensor posts on forums, see what problems people have

outline, goals
write with nouns and verbs... flowery = bye
clarity==simplicity. overwriting==underthinking
do not overstate
don't mix metaphors
make every word tell
honest, transparent
Remove all hype

individually tested
carefully developed
Try one for $6.
$6 to stop dealing with ADC/analog forever.
$6 defeats analog sensors
add more analog sensors
are you ready to conquer analog? for $6?
conquer analog sensors
stop hating analog
analog made digital made easy made anything possible
THE analog sensor solution
Convert analog sensors/rangers to I2C, SPI, serial
Works with all Sharp IR Rangers, or all 5v analog sensors
IR sensors galore
simple easy to use (trite)
all the digital processing done for you.
Analog. Solved.
lots of analog, zero hassle
analog smart easy solved simple fast convenient
immediate
easy to get started

Wishing my Sharp rangers had a digital interface, I made one.
lacking analog ports? who cares?
27 devices per bus. try that with analog.
