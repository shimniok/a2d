# Introduction #
Convert the popular Sharp IR Sensor to an I2C (or SPI or Serial).

Reliable, low noise, high resolution.

Finally a signal worth of the Sharp IR Sensor's capabilities.

# Analog. Solved. #
All the hard work's done for you so you can concentrate on the fun stuff.

# Flexible. Hackable. #
You can upgrade _any_ analog Sharp IR sensor. Or any 5V analog sensor.

Flash SPI, I2C, Serial firmware. Write your own code.

# Many, Many Sensors #
Up to 27 sensors on a single I2C bus. Try that with analog.

# High Resolution. Low Noise. High Bandwidth. #
You choose up to 4096X oversampling for up to 16 bit resolution.

A configurable high performance exponential software filter reduces noise at your discretion.

Conversion rates of 125kSPS. Custom-tuned analog anti-alias filter. Sharp sensor bandwidth? No problem.

# Simple. Efficient. #
Send address, read two bytes.

The I2C protocol is designed for maximum efficiency and minimum complexity.

Configuration is simple too. Send the address, register, and value.
